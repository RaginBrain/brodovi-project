## The idea behind the example

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

This example demonstrates how you can use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) together with Material UI.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the default style engine in Material UI v5.

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->
I dont know why but we are on branch master....


You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation and continue by browsing the [templates](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/) section.
